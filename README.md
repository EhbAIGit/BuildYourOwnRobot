It's commonly used in robotics and RC (remote control) applications due to its reliability, affordability, and versatility. The "360 degrees" designation typically refers to the continuous rotation modification that can be applied to this servo, allowing it to rotate continuously in either direction rather than being limited to a specific range of motion like traditional servos.</td>

<h2>Hardware connections</h2>

Correctly connecting all components is crucial for proper functionality. While alternative connections are possible, the examples provided in the software utilize specific connections. Therefore, we recommend adhering to these suggested connections for optimal compatibility and ease of use.

Remark that in the software these pins are as follows :

servo_pin1 = D11;  // Left Servo 
servo_pin2 = D12;  // right Servo
 
trigger = D15;   // Ultrasonic sensor trigger pin
echo    = D2;    // Ultrasonic sensor echo pin



<h2>Getting started</h2>

Install Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).  There you can download latest version. 

Go to the "File" menu and select "Preferences".

In the "Additional Board Manager URLs" field, add the following URL:
http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
Separate multiple URLs with commas if you have others already listed.

Click "OK" to close the Preferences window.

Now, go to the "Tools" menu, select "Board", and then click on "Boards Manager".

In the Boards Manager window, type "esp8266" into the search bar.

Select the "esp8266" entry by ESP8266 Community and click the "Install" button.
Wait for the installation process to complete. Once installed, close the Boards Manager window.

Now, you can select the ESP8266 board from the "Tools" > "Board" menu. You'll find various ESP8266 boards listed under the "ESP8266 Boards (2.7.4)" menu. Choose the appropriate board that matches your ESP8266 module.

We have following board LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R1 :

After selecting the board, you can proceed with writing and uploading sketches for the ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE as you would for any other Arduino board.


<h2>Uploading a sketch program to your robot</h2>


Open chatgpt and select the 3.5 turbo or a newer model if you have access to newest models.  In the chat set your context :


"I have a WEMOS D1 R2 with an ultrasonic sensor (trigger pin D15 and echo pin D2). Can you write a program in Arduino that continuously displays the distance? Please do this without using the library, but simply using time measurement."
