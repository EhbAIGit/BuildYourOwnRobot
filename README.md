<h2>Parts to buy</h2>

<h3>WEMOS D1 Wifi</h3>
The Wemos D1 WiFi board is a compact microcontroller board based on the ESP8266 chipset, which integrates WiFi connectivity. It's a development board similar to the Arduino, but with built-in WiFi capability, making it ideal for IoT (Internet of Things) projects and wireless communication applications.

<h3>Sensor shield v5.0</h3>
The Arduino Sensor Shield V5 is a versatile expansion board designed to simplify the process of connecting and interfacing various sensors and modules with Arduino microcontroller boards. Compatible with Arduino Uno, Mega, and other similar boards, the Sensor Shield V5 offers a convenient way to expand the capabilities of your Arduino projects. It can be placed on top of the WEMOS D1 wifi board, so no soldering is required to connect all robot parts.

<h3>360 degrees continuous rotation Servo's</h3>

The S3003 is a standard-sized servo motor manufactured by TowerPro. It's commonly used in robotics and RC (remote control) applications due to its reliability, affordability, and versatility. The "360 degrees" designation typically refers to the continuous rotation modification that can be applied to this servo, allowing it to rotate continuously in either direction rather than being limited to a specific range of motion like traditional servos.
